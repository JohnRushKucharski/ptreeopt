NEED TO DO:
- Precision of feature variables (integer, etc.)
- Autocorrelation of errors when fitting the historical policy (see Julie's email)
- colors for the state variable animations. Make one nice figure for the AGU abstract submission.

See lit review in Yang et al. 2016 WRR submission for decision tree (fitting ML) in reservoir ops. Starts with Bessler et al. 2003.

Also see their calculation (in the first paper) of Gini coefficients for each feature variable. The same could apply to ptreeopt.
